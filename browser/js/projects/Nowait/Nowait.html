        <h3>Description:</h3> No Wait is an npm module, which - when installed globally - gives users a command line interface for 
        calling the elevator in a building - thereby reducing congestion and wait time in the hall.
        <br></br>
        No wait was created as part of a 1 day Tessel hackathon at Fullstack Academy of Code, during which participants were each given 1 Tessel and a series of Tessel modules chosen at random. No wait utilizes a command line tool to make a request to a server which then sends a command to the Tessel over the local network.
        Upon receiving this command, the tessel activates a servo which moves an arm that mechanically presses the elevator button for the user!
        <br></br>
        This project won "Best Campus Improvement" at Fullstack Academy's Tessel Hackathon.
