Data taken from NASA archive of confirmed exoplanets. Planets are placed based on distance from earth in parsecs, and sized in earth radii per pixel. For self-evident reasons, only planets with confirmed sizes / distances are shown. Colors are based on the following scale and represent the equilibrium temperature of each planet:

                with white planets representing bodies with no confirmed equilibrium temperature data.

                You can hover over each planet for its data. Earth is the one with the blue ping.
